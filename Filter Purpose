This filterâ€™s purpose is to log details about every HTTP request and the time it took to process it. 

This is extremely useful for:

-> Performance Monitoring: By logging the request processing time (duration), you can identify slow requests and measure the performance of your application.

-> Debugging: Logging the method, URI, and status code of each request helps trace the flow of requests through the system, 
    especially when troubleshooting errors.

-> Auditing: This logging can serve as an audit trail, tracking what requests were made to the server and how the server responded to them.
