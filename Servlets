The HTTP servlet API is based on two main abstract types:

-> HttpServlet - responsible for ultimately handling an HTTP request by populating an HttpServletResponse using information from a HttpServletRequest.

-> HttpFilter - contributes to the handling of HTTP responses, by using the requestâ€™s information, present in an HttpServletResponse instance,
and eventually mutating an HttpServletResponse before and after the request is handled by a server. Multiple filters are organized in a pipeline.
