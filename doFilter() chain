Code : chain.doFilter(request, response)

   This is crucial for allowing the request to proceed to the next filter or the target servlet (such as the Spring controller).
  
When you call chain.doFilter(), the request is passed down the filter chain, and after all filters are processed,
  it reaches the target controller method that handles the request.
This call is what actually allows the HTTP request to be processed.
  Without this line, the request would be blocked, and the client would never get a response.
